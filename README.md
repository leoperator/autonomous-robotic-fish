## üöÄ Overview

The **Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle (B.U.V.)** is a servo-actuated underwater robot inspired by fish locomotion. It demonstrates fish-like swimming using oscillatory tail motion and flapping pectoral fins, powered by compact, open-source electronics. The robot is designed to be modular, waterproof, and buoyant‚Äîideal for exploring underwater robotics with minimal resources.

## üß† Features

- Servo-actuated **pectoral** and **caudal fins** for biomimetic motion
- **Modular 3D-printed body** using PLA+
- **Onboard LiDAR** (VL53L0X) for obstacle detection
- Waterproofed chambers and silicone-sealed joints
- Depth control using a piston-based **buoyancy chamber**
- Controlled by a compact **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-Sense**
- Powered by **LiFePO4 batteries** with regulated 5V output

## üìê CAD and Design

Designed in **OnShape**, the robot features three primary segments:
- **Head**: ESP32 microcontroller, camera, and LiDAR sensor
- **Mid-section**: SG92R servos for pectoral fin control
- **Tail**: MG90S servo for caudal fin oscillation

- **Boost Converter** ‚Üí Stabilize power to 5V
- **Common Ground** ‚Üí Ensures stable operation


## üìå Objectives

- ‚úîÔ∏è Mimic fish-like swimming with fins and tail
- ‚úîÔ∏è Ensure underwater operation with waterproofing
- ‚úîÔ∏è Use low-cost, off-the-shelf components
- ‚úîÔ∏è Achieve modular and compact robot body
- ‚úîÔ∏è Provide a testbed for underwater robotic research

## ‚ùó Limitations & Future Work

- Static waterproofing (not suitable for deep water)
- No closed-loop control or IMU feedback
- Basic sensing (only LiDAR for obstacle avoidance)

### üîÆ Planned Improvements
